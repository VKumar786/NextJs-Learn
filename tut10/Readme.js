    TODO: Catch-all Segments of Route
    ? get Route name from url
    ? how to get all segments of Route
    * localhost:3000/login/loginStudent - have 3 segment which are follow as localhost:3000, login, loginStudent

    ! drawback of dynamic routing is like
        * we can access localhost:3000/studentList/{student}
        * it become difficult to access localhost:3000/studentList/{student}/23/1/it
